 escape all dynamic content coming from a data store, so the browser knows it is to be treated as the contents of HTML tags, as opposed to raw HTML.

Escaping dynamic content generally consists of replacing significant characters with the HTML entity encoding:

"	&#34
#	&#35
&	&#38
'	&#39
(	&#40
)	&#41
/	&#47
;	&#59
<	&#60
>	&#62
